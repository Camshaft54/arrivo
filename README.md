# Arrivo: Realtime Amtrak Train Tracker
Arrivo is a modern Android app with a widget for quickly viewing the status of Amtrak trains.
## Why Arrivo?
Universal transit apps like Transit and Google Maps currently only display scheduled departures for Amtrak routes, whereas Arrivo uses Amtrak's unofficial realtime status API to display the latest information about arrival times, better accounting for service disruptions.

The official Amtrak app and unofficial apps like Amtraker also provide this info, but Arrivo differentiates itself with an Android-first approach. Arrivo features a clean Material 3 UI with support for dark mode and dynamic color.
